HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. 
It provides the basic structure of web pages, allowing text, images, and other content to be organized and displayed in browsers. 
HTML is not a programming language; rather, it is a markup language that defines the structure and layout of a web document by using a variety of tags and attributes.

Role of HTML in Web Development
HTML serves as the backbone of web development, playing a crucial role in the following areas:

Content Structuring: HTML provides a way to structure content on the web. Elements like headings, paragraphs,
 lists, links, and images are all defined using HTML tags. This structured content ensures that web pages are 
 easily readable and accessible to users.

Semantic Meaning: HTML5 introduced semantic elements such as <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>, 
which provide meaning to the web content. These elements improve the accessibility and search engine optimization 
(SEO) of web pages by clearly defining different parts of the content.

Integration with Other Technologies: HTML works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript 
to create fully functional and visually appealing websites. While HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, 
and JavaScript adds interactivity. Together, they form the foundation of modern web development.

Accessibility: HTML is essential for creating accessible websites. By using proper HTML tags and attributes, 
developers can ensure that web content is accessible to users with disabilities, including those who rely on 
screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: HTML is supported by all web browsers, ensuring that web pages can be viewed and 
interacted with consistently across different platforms and devices. This compatibility is vital for providing a uniform user experience.

Document Linking: One of the primary features of HTML is the ability to link to other documents via hyperlinks. 
This interconnected nature of web documents forms the basis of the World Wide Web, allowing users to navigate between related content seamlessly.
